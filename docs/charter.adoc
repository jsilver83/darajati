== Project Title

Darajati


== Project Justifications

* This system is a mission critical system since it handles attendance and grading for the biggest academic department
in KFUPM.
* This system holds sensitive data and no security testing was done sufficiently on it.
* This system currently doesn't have a proper testing environment.
* There were some reported issues with availability and performance of the current This system.
* There is crucial pending requests by the client but the current This system is hard to extend (lack of extensibility).
* There are requests to use the system in other departments with similar requirements. However, the current system might
not be able to handle more load (lack of scalability).
* The current system has a weak link with banner. A proper synchronization mechanism should be implemented in the new
system.


== Project Objectives

There are five main objectives of this project:

* Load scalability and performance
* Extensibility
* Reducing manual work and improving automation
* Improving synchronization with Banner


== Project Scope

* Allow teachers to take students' attendance to classes
* Allow coordinators and teachers to enter students' grades
* Allow coordinators, teachers, and students to view attendances and grades reports through BI
* Synchronize data between this system and banner


== Project Considerations

. Risks:

* It will require a relatively big team with members who have good technical grasp over Django.
* Since his system is dealing with several academic departments, we might run into conflicting requirements that will
be difficult to accommodate into one system.

. Assumptions:

* Flexibility from the departments' side  with special grading policies.
* Enough support from department heads during the development and piloting this system.

. Issues:

* The reports done on the old system will become obsolete with the new system. New reports have to be implemented by
the BI team.
* Data migration from current system to the new one will be tricky and time consuming.
* Banner XE/9 (the newer Banner) might overlap with this system in terms of functionality.

. Dependencies (on any other project(s) or activities):

* Banner
* OSIS
* CAS
